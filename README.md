# Racing Through Our Nights
This game was created for the semester project during our advanced programming class in the 2nd semester of college which was at February - June of 2023. 

This game is NOT optimized and it's fully made with TurboC's graphics.h library only in 1 code file (which was the challenge from our lecturer)
